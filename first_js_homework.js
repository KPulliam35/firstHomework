// Section1

//What does the acronym DRY stand for? Why should we pay attention to it? What programming tools have we learned to write DRY code?

// DRY stand for "Dont Repeat Yourself" // This will help us not to write the same code over and over again // Loop & Boolean 

// What is the difference between const and let and var? Please limit your answer to no more than three short sentences. Don't be afraid to research using google and other resources

// Const maintains constnt values, Let is block scope and only available for use within that block, Var is at the top of the scope before the code execution.

// Section2 I'm not sure how to do this section of the homework

  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kelvin';
  const f = false;

  console.log(a < b)
  console.log()

// Section3 I need to review more, bc I'm not making sense of this section of the homework
/*Is the code below an infinite loop? Why or why not?
Don't worry about getting it 'wrong' - you'll be graded on your reasoning, not if your ultimate answer is correct.

let letters = "A";
let i = 0;

while (i < 20) {
	letters += "A";

// Section4 
// Write a for loop that will console.log the numbers 0 to 999.
//basic for loop


// for(let i=0; i<999; i++){
